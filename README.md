This is a Fraud Detection Microservices App.
I'm currently creating it using Spring Boot as my microservices framework, Docker to contain the databases and the different microservices and Eureka for Services Discovery.
I'm adding more and more technologies to it as I'm learning and applying.
The purpose from this app is to rely on DevOps, Backend Development and Machine Learning practices to be able to:
- Develop a Microservices application from scratch using Spring Boot.
- Add Notification handling using RabbitMQ and/or Kafka.
- Use Docker containers for the different modules.
- Orchestrate the communication using Eureka and automate the management using Kubernetes.
- Create unit tests, integration tests and system tests of the different operations.
- Detect fraudulent financial transactions of clients with a DNN using Tensorflow.
